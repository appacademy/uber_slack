## Support

Uber on Slack is an open-source project, which means that we need you, as users,
to be our eyes and ears. If you're having a problem, please
[create a Github issue][create-issue] and try to provide as much detail as possible.

Please include:

* The text of the request you made
* The text of the response UberOnSlack gave you
* The time at which the error occurred
* (Also, do double-check: are you sure you have a valid Uber account?)

With that, please create a new issue (unless you see one that matches your error)
and we'll try to fix it as soon as we can. :)

(If you don't have a Github account, you can also contact us at contact@appacademy.io.)

Best,<br>
Uber on Slack Team
